            <p class="lead">The <span class="maroon">Job Automation Probability Simulator</span> is a project that was assigned to and developed by the COMP 313 class for Loyola's School of Continuing and Professional Studies during the spring semester of 2018. Today's technology is drastically changing the job landscape across a multitude of industries.  According to many reputable news sources, by 2026, it is estimated that nearly 1 million human jobs will be replaced by automation.  This means that human workers will need to acquire new skills to meet the demands of the marketplace to continue to find paid work.</p>

            <p class="lead">Due to this new demand for automated technology in the workforce, individuals, organizations, and higher education institutions must adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape.  This new reality will undoubtly put more pressure on educational institutions and individuals to reimagine the traditional, four-year educational model so that new graduates are better prepared to compete against automation.</p>
